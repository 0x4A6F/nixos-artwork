NixOS Logo
==========

This is the canonical location of the NixOS logo, affectionately called the
*Nix Snowflake*.

Technicalities
--------------

### Font

A logo with the baked-in outline is made available and is recognized as the
*de-facto* version of the logo, since the font's exact revision, for its
metrics and the software used to produce the outlines is unknown. Using a
recent revision of the font with a recent inkscape produces different outlines.

The font used is *[Vegur](http://dotcolon.net/font/vegur/)*, a CC0 font,
[as contributed to the *nixos-homepage*](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/blob/3219f5449643f5ee73095b1944f349b646ccf9c8/logo/nixos-hex.svg)
project. (Disregard the presence of *Carlito* font-family, it is an artifact
from the way the text boxes were made.)

### Using the logo

The svg source files have a *logo-guide* and those with text a *guide* layer.
Ensure the snowflake has at least the given margin with any other elements with
other elements when used. The source SVG files with text already have the
margin baked into the files.
